 This study focuses on the intrinsic relationship between the steady-state convergence speed of Markov chains in network systems and the characteristics of their one-step transition matrices. By conducting an in-depth analysis of the eigenvalue distribution of the one-step transition matrix and its eigenvectors, we aim to uncover how these characteristics influence the dynamic process of network systems converging to a steady state.
