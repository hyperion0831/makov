 This study focuses on the intrinsic relationship between the steady-state convergence speed of Markov chains in network systems and the characteristics of their one-step transition matrices. By conducting an in-depth analysis of the eigenvalue distribution of the one-step transition matrix and its eigenvectors, we aim to uncover how these characteristics influence the dynamic process of network systems converging to a steady state.

We used automated scripts to generate a large amount of data and plotted it to fit the graph shown below:

As seen, the number of convergence steps is positively correlated with the second largest eigenvalue. The closer the second largest eigenvalue is to 0, the faster the convergence speed.
